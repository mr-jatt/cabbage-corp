This is my [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) landing page project. I didn't follow the direction exactly because I wanted to have some fun with it. The page is a mild fan fiction of a character in the animated series Avatar the Last Airbender. The Cabbage seller named Cai, who would have run-ins with the main character Aang and would end up with his cart full of cabbages destroyed.
